# Level 1: Foundations

Welcome to level1\
The aim of this task is to get you started with AIML + GitHub.\
You will contribute small but essential **utility functions** and **heuristic algorithms**.\
These functions will later be used in more complex scenarios down the line.

---

## Tasks

You will have to complete the following:

1. Implement **sigmoid**, **ReLU**, **tanh** functions (using Python's `math` library).
2. Write the logic for **vector dot product** and **cosine similarity**.
3. Implement **normalization** (L1, L2, min-max).
4. Add a simple heuristic function (eg: greedy move for tic-tac-toe).
   > Note, you can implement **any heuristic function**, there is no constraint on which one to choose.

## Directory

All your contributions for this level go inside: `level1-utils/<your-github-username>`

This way, we can keep track of every contributor's work easily, all in one place.

> Please refrain from modifying the contents of other contributors' directories, and keep things clean.

## Goal

- Learn the repo structure
- Make your first Pull Request (PR)
- Get comfortable with contributing on GitHub

---

## Contribution checklist

- [ ] Create a directory with your GitHub username under `level1-utils/`
- [ ] Add a Python file (e.g., `functions.py`) with your implementations
- [ ] Ensure functions are well-documented with docstrings
- [ ] (Optional) Add a small test script (`test_functions.py`) to demonstrate usage
- [ ] Run your code locally to check for errors
- [ ] Commit your changes with a meaningful message (eg: *"Added sigmoid, ReLU, tanh functions"*)
- [ ] Open a Pull Request to the main repo
  - Include a clear description of what you implemented
  - Mention any references/resources you used (even tools like ChatGPT)
- [ ] Respond to review comments if requested and update your PR
